# Hierarchical-clustering-and-PCA
Using Hierarchical clustering to group a Nutrient composition dataset into clusters based on their characteristics or features, This project will be done using Agglomerative clustering.

Hierarchical clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar objects or data points into clusters based on their characteristics or features. It is called "hierarchical" because it builds a hierarchy of nested clusters.

In hierarchical clustering, each data point is initially considered as a separate cluster, and then the algorithm repeatedly merges the two closest clusters until all the data points belong to one big cluster. The distance between two clusters is calculated based on a similarity metric, such as Euclidean distance, cosine distance, or correlation coefficient.

There are two types of hierarchical clustering algorithms: agglomerative and divisive. In agglomerative clustering, the algorithm starts with individual data points and recursively merges them into larger clusters. In divisive clustering, the algorithm starts with one big cluster and recursively divides it into smaller clusters.

The output of hierarchical clustering is a dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that shows how the data points are clustered together at different levels of granularity. The dendrogram can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters to use for downstream analysis.
